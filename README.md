### Project Title
Investigate a Realational Database - Sakila DVD Rental Database

### Project Details
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 

### Description
In this project, I made use of SQL- PostgreSQL to extract data from 14 differnet related tables from the sakila dvd rental database.
